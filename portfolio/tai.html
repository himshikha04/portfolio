<p>An internship is like a job before the real job where students get a chance to apply the knowledge they have gained through academics in a practical, workplace setting. It helps the candidate experience what it is like to work in a specific career field and gain relevant knowledge and skills.
 

Training is more like a skill-acquisition program where your current employers train you on a specific skill or domain. Training is conducted for both fresher as well as for experienced employees to keep them updated. It is more like an education program where the emphasis is on practical learning than abstract theatrical learning
